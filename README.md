# RESTy
### LAB - Component Based UI

### Phase 1 Requirements

- The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

   - As a user, I expect an easy to read and understand user interface so that I can use the application intuitively
   - As a user, I want to enter the URL to a REST API and select the REST method to use to access it
   - As a user, I want visual confirmation that my entries and selections are valid so that I have confidence the application will be able to fetch the API data that Iâ€™ve requested
- And as developers, here are the high level development tasks that address the above end user requirements

  - Create a visually appealing site with a Header, Footer, and a large content area
Create a form that asks for a URL
   - Create buttons that let the user choose from the REST methods (get, post, put, delete)
   - When the form is filled out, and the button is clicked, display the URL and the method chosen.

### Create React App

- npx create-react-app my-app
- cd my-app
- npm start

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
